Somewhat of a "fork" of: https://github.com/TerryHowe/ansible-modules-hashivault

We quite happily would just simply use upstream instead of maintaining this but 
unfortunately upstream has not yet migrated to collection and it seems impossible 
to have a standard (non-galaxy?) role repo as dependency for collection roles (in awx?). 
If there exists a solution it is quite hard to find and also rather unintuive as we more 
or less tried more or less anything before starting this.
